		     	<p>
		        	The following link leads to a web application that the Friday Night Computer Science Reading Group (the Cabal) has used to choose the papers it wants to read. I (Jim Rootham) wrote the software and created the site.

		        	The following voting rules were agreed upon:
		        	<ul>
		        		<li>Each member is entitled to 15 votes.</li>
		        		<li>Each member may vote a maximum of 5 times for a specific paper.</li> 
		        		<li>The paper receiving the most votes is the winner.</li>
    				</ul>

				<h3>No Password</h3>
					<p>
						This is a site that I am using to develop an application that eliminates the need for a password to enter a site, while maintaining the security of the site and the confidentiality of the user.  The site permits the visitor to try out the current version of the application.
