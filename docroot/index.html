		    	<h3>Reading Group Papers</h3>
		     	<p>
		        	The following links lead to instances of a web application that the Friday Night Computer Science Reading Group (the Cabal) has used to choose the papers it wants to read. I (Jim Rootham) wrote the software and created the site.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		        	The following voting rules were agreed upon:
		        	<ul>
		        		<li>Each member is entitled to 15 votes.</li>
		        		<li>Each member may vote a maximum of 5 times for a specific paper.</li> 
		        		<li>The paper receiving the most votes is the one to read.</li>
    				</ul> 
		     </p>
		     <p>
		     	The application is now also being used to select papers for the Thursday Night Group and book chapters.

				<h3>Email Signon</h3>
					<p>
						This is a site that I am using to develop an application that eliminates the need for a password to enter a site, while maintaining the security of the site and the confidentiality of the user.  The site permits the visitor to try out the current version of the application.					
					</p>
					<p>
						Note:  The voting software linked to above uses this signon mechanism.
